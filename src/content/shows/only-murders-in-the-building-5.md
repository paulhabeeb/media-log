The scenes with Mabel’s mom fall so flat it hurts. I don’t buy that she’s a struggling mom, or at least used to be, and I don’t buy any of the feelings she has for her daughter. Also, Oscar doesn’t seem like a guy who just did thirteen years in prison. The thing that really makes this go is the combination of the three leads.
