The new focus on the podcast sponsor as the suspect feels sudden and flimsy and totally circumstantial. If he’s really involved, I’ll be upset. And the reveal of who killed the girl all those years ago is annoying because it’s a result of this flimsy connection.

That said, I welcome the technical challenge of showing most of the episode from a deaf character’s POV.
