## About

This site is inspired by Steven Soderbergh’s <a href="https://extension765.com/blogs/soderblog">Seen, Read</a> and Tom MacWright’s <a href="https://macwright.com/reading/">reading log</a>. Sites like IMDb, Letterboxd, and Goodreads are great for logging what you watch and read, and they’re wonderful for discovery, but each site lets you track only one type of media (books, movies, etc). I wanted a central location to log everything.

There’s also something to be said for owning your data and being able to take it anywhere you want. A big site might implement a policy you aren’t happy with (or even <a href="https://www.somebits.com/weblog/tech/bad/goodreads-lost-all-my-data.html">lose all your data</a>). Logging my viewing and reading habits here means the data is in my control.

This site is build in Eleventy and hosted on Netlify. The rewatch/reread icon was created by <a href="https://thenounproject.com/icon/loop-1098238/">Kiran Shastry</a>.
