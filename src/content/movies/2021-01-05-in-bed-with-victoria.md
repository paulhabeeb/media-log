This was a nice surprise. The English title and the poster made me think I was in for a dumb rom-com, but no. It isn’t perfect, but it’s much more complex than what I expected.

The contrast between Efira and Lacoste is interesting. It’s a standard nerd vs pretty girl dynamic, but it’s handled and played in such a serious context that it transcends stereotypes. I didn’t love <i>Sibyl</i> when I watched it recently, but Efira is able to give her characters in both films a certain unexpected quality that’s quite refreshing. I’d say it’s the writing, but I think it’s more than that. Maybe it’s just my personal bias. She looks like a tv anchor, but she achieves depth you never get from a tv anchor delivering the news. That’s quite unique. And of course she’s given an interesting character to work with.

But I do feel that the direction is a bit messy. Triet reaches for something admirable but doesn’t quite pull it off. I appreciate the shot choice and blocking, but I wish she’d just let some of the scenes play rather than use flashback. The images don’t contrast enough to create deeper meaning than we’d get by remaining in the scene.
