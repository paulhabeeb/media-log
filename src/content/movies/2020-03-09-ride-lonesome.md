Some westerns treat their women well, and some don’t. This one’s somewhere in the middle. I don’t love the way the guys talk about her, but she does handle herself well in tough situations.

The rest of the movie is great, though. I could’ve taken another ten minutes, but I appreciate how lean it is.
