I don’t have much to say about the craft of the script. It works. I have nothing to critique, but also nothing that wowed me, structurally.

Some of the performances aren’t quite what I expected, particularly early on. But it turns into a solid noir. Art Smith and Thomas Gomez are standouts. The long opening take is great.
