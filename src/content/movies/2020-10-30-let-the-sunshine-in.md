The story was so empty that I have to wonder if the version I watched on Hulu suffered from poor subtitles. But from the way the scenes were structured, I imagine that no, the story is just a lot of nothing. We get Juliette’s character reflected through the men she sees, and very little of her as herself. This sounds interesting, but it diminishes her character so much that the movie becomes nothing at all.

On top of that, there are multiple times when they cross the line in such a jarring way that I had to rewind and watch the scene over. I don’t mind a nice line break, but these were rough.
