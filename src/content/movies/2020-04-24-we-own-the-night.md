One of the best car chases ever. Reminds me of the chase in <i>Ad Astra</i>.

Once again, the story itself doesn’t break any new ground, but Gray’s craft is outstanding. The acting, cinematography, blocking, all excellent.

I’m trying to understand my reaction to his movies. So far I’ve seen <i>The Yards</i>, <i>We Own the Night</i>, and <i>Ad Astra</i>. They’ve all been slow and operatic. I never particularly empathize with the characters, but that’s not to say their journeys ever feel forced. I believe their emotional realities. I’m never particularly compelled by the stories, but I admire the high level of craft. They’re done so well I can’t imagine any other way to do them.

Actually, now I remember that I saw <i>Two Lovers</i> several years ago. I don’t remember it being so dry. I guess my question is why these three have felt so uninteresting yet so well done.
