I love Siodmak — his name should be brought up as much as the likes of Hitchcock or Ford or Hawks — but this didn’t work quite as well as it could’ve. Just a bit dated, and not enough people who could be a suspect, giving it less suspense than it could/should have had. But the performances are great, and so is the sound design. All that thunder. So good.
