The thing that stood out to me here is the humanity of the babysitter and the two QAnon guys. It was heartwarming, particularly the babysitter. I appreciate Cohen's desire to make a political impact, but here there's nothing new or unexpected, politically. It feels more likely to divide than it will transcend.
