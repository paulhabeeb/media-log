Jennifer Lopez and Constance Wu are excellent. The cameos are fun. There are some great camera moves.

But I wish the tone had been bleaker. Strip out three quarters of the music, and just let the scenes ride with natural sound. Give us just a little more grit, and the movie goes to a whole nother place.

That said, it’s way better than it could’ve been.
