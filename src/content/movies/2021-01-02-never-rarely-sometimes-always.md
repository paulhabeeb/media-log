There are some wonderfully tender and understated moments here, but the story feels preoccupied with making the bleakest possible situations happen. These girls are in a bleak situation, no doubt, but there is something very slightly off in the script, though I canâ€™t put my finger on it after only one watch. That said, this fits in nicely with the NYC created by <i>Heaven Knows What</i>, <i>Frownland</i>, and <i>Christmas, Again</i>. Very much my style.
