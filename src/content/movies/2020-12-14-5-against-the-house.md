A noir with a happy ending and no death. Its two main characters fought in Korea and came back to attend college as older men. One deals with PTSD. Most of the film shows them at college, with not much really happening. Things pick up in the last twenty minutes. The heist is great, but the whole movie lacks suspense. You can see where things are headed the whole time.
