Wonderful sound work that fades in and out between Ahmed’s point of view (point of hearing?) and ours. His struggle really feels like that — a struggle — and it’s refreshing to see him move through different stages, first not wanting to accept, then growing into it, enjoying helping the kids, becoming a part of the new community, then wanting his old life back, betraying his new community, and finally pursuing what he wants but ultimately leaving unsatisfied.
