Second viewing. Beautifully constructed. The combination of nonlinear story with a cocoon of emotion is unlike anything I've seen. A lot of it is sound design. We're rooted in a very specific feeling throughout the film, despite jumping through time. I don't even know when the opening shot takes place — before Fonny goes to jail? after? — but it works. Tish's narration carries us through.

The visuals are beautiful, but I find some of the decisions on shot choice and camera placement odd. It's like Jenkins couldn't pick one angle he liked, so he shot a bunch of different ones. I'd need to watch it again to know if he actually crosses the line (I don't think he does), but sometimes you get the disorienting feeling that he did.
