First time I've watched it in the past 18 years. The first thirty or forty minutes are still really great, which is probably why they're all I remembered. The cut from the rooftop to Dae-su drunk in the police station, the octopus scene, Dae-su holding the guy off the roof by his tie, the hallway fight — all really wonderful.

Those scenes hold a lot of mystery, but once Dae-su finds Woo-jin in the apartment next door, everything gets explained away and the story is tied up neatly. And as much as we learn about Woo-jin, his revenge on Dae-su never feels connected to the explanation we get. He feels like a shell of a character, and since the rest of the movie is predicated on finding out his motivation, the rest of the movie feels hollow. After all that, why? The first half is interesting because we don't know why. Once we find out? Eh.
