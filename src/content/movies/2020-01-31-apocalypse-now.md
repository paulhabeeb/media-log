Sound design might be the most underrated and underutilized aspect of filmmaking. Everyone focuses on actors, directors, even cinematographers. But all thatâ€™s for naught if you have a bad sound track.

Apocalypse Now is the second movie I've watched this year that's convinced me of that. The other being Uncut Gems. More films should treat their sound with such reverence.

Also surprised that more people on Letterboxd haven't seen this version.
