<i>“What a grip — that’s from counting money.”</i>
<i>
</i>This is really much more of a psychological portrait of Bogart’s character than it is any kind of mystery or crime story. I wish it did more for me. The first half hour and last twenty minutes are solid, but the middle is dull and lacks the suspense that would take the movie to the next level. But I do love the title. It conjures up such a beautiful image. Unfortunately it’s not one I get from the movie itself.
