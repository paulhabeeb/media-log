The opening scene, at night and in the rain, is beautifully lit. You don’t see things lit that way these days.

And wow, this is hilarious. A proto-Tarantino.

That said, it feels weird watching these guys die along the way — not fighting Nazis, but on their way to a bank heist. You could argue that they <b>were</b> fighting Nazis, but I don’t know how compelling I find that argument. The whole thing doesn’t really work as a satire, either. Some of the pieces are there, but does it bite enough? I’m not sure. Not to make the deaths feel any more justified.
