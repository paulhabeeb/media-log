This didn't work for me, largely because of the performances. I don't know if it's the difficulty of directing/acting in a foreign language or what exactly. There are a few moments of real greatness and beauty, but the rest feels awkward and stilted and would completely change my opinion of Isabelle Huppert if I loved her just a little bit less.
