I hadn’t watched this all the way through in a few years. It’s about family so much more than I remembered. Sure, the all-consuming greed is there, which is what had left an impression on me. But the brunt of the movie is about Daniel dealing with family or the loss thereof. H.W., Henry — at the end even Eli refers to him as a brother. And what enrages him? Why does his deal with Standard Oil not go through? They mention H.W., and then later he taunts them with him.
