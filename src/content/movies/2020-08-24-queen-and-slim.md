There are a few scenes where characters tell Queen and Slim that they’ve done something good, something that gives other people hope, and Queen and Slim are clearly disconcerted by this interpretation of their actions. This was the most interesting part of the movie for me. I wish it had been the main concern. The idea that something can grow far beyond what you ever meant or wanted. That’s a compelling problem. Waithe still could have fit in all the other stuff she wanted to talk about, and perhaps in a more poignant way.

I do appreciate the idea of a movie about criminals on the run that spends more time being Before Sunrise than it spends being Bonnie & Clyde. But unfortunately what we have is bloated and filmed in a way that looks cool for Instagram. Cut this down to an hour fourty-five, shoot it in 1.85 on Superspeeds, and give us something more raw.
