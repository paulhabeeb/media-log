In retrospect, I’m surprised at how much I really loved this when it came out. It’s good fun, though.

It's all about the mood. Comic book movies had never felt like this before. Nolan and crew nail that gritty feeling. And Heath Ledger's Joker is quite wonderful.

Apart from these two things, there's not much interesting about it. It's surprisingly empty. I say surprising because I remember being deeply compelled the first time I saw it. This time? Not so much. Times change, tastes change.
