Delivered something much greater than I expected. It looks at mental health in a way most teen films completely ignore. It's so honest and raw about Nadine's character that she borders on unsympathetic. We get to see how her depression and anxiety control her life and her relationships with her brother, mom, and best friend.

That said, a lot of Nadine's dialogue with Woody Harrelson's character made me cringe, and the plot hardly breaks from convention. It succeeds only because of its deep dive into Nadine's psyche. But it's worth it for that alone.
