Colin Farrell’s struggle felt a bit hollow by the end, but the story’s conceit works. The setup is pleasurable — watching McGregor fall for the girl and Farrell’s luck rise then fall. And we keep hearing about Uncle Howard, who seems to be the answer to all problems, but actually causes problems of the worst kind. I felt for the guys as they struggled to do the job. But once it’s done, tension is mostly deflated.
