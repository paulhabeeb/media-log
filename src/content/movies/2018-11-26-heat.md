Somehow I hated this the first time I saw it. This time around it strikes me in a completely different way. Much more intelligent and intentional than before. Michael Mann builds suspense with image and sound, and it’s overwhelming. His sound effects — not just his gunshot sounds but also his airplanes, cars, hospital noises — they’re all precise and intentional. I was reminded of the scene in Last of the Mohicans when the British party is attacked by the Huron. The suspense before the attack is excruciating. I felt similar emotions in many scenes here.
