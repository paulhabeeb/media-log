This moved me very much when I watched it, but the more I think about it, the less I like it.

The ending almost made me cry. But now that I’m not under the movie’s spell, it feels silly and contrived.

The first hour was excellent. Amy Adams suiting up to going into the ship — her performance there was perfect.
