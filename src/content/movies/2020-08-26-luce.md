I'm skeptical, overall, of film adaptations of plays, and I can usually spot them in the first fifteen minutes. It wasn't until the credits rolled on this that I thought it was probably based on a play.

It handles its material very well, and channels its message through its characters. I appreciate and admire the craft at work.

That said, the story seemed torn about whose perspective it wanted to be told from: Luce's or his mother's. Most of the story is filtered through the mother's POV, and it's only toward the end when we start to understand Luce's motive. Revealing his motive earlier on would reduce a lot of the tension, but ignoring it until the end makes his admissions feel tacked on. Still, I don't think the movie needs to choose one perspective over another, and this is a small weak point in an otherwise outstanding film.
