My expectations were set by a <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/i-used-to-go-here-185242-1.jpeg" rel="nofollow">single still</a> I saw on Indiewire several months back. That still conveyed a certain bleak, lonely tone, and the end result is much different, though still enjoyable. I was expecting something more like <i>Columbus</i>.

The setup works, but once we reach the second act the story starts to rely on cliches rather than unique characters. We never sink too deep into a moment, but instead see several moments strung together to create an effect. It's enjoyable, but there would be more power in seeing Kate struggle within a single moment. I'm not talking about longer scenes, but deeper ones.

For example, the scene when she's at the bar with Bradley "Brad" Cooper and his girlfriend. It gets pretty uncomfortable for her, but we skim past it pretty quickly. We don't get to see Kate deal with that moment. The movie runs away from it instead.

All that said, Gillian Jacobs is wonderful, and I enjoy watching anything she's in.
