Richard Widmark is really wonderful. This story creates tension in an interesting way by starting with a jailbreak by a man who not only is the marshal in a nearby town but is also breaking out a man who wants to kill him. The tension remains high throughout the rest of the film, and it ends with a wonderful shootout. It’s a solid western, though it doesn’t reach the heights of John Ford.
