I appreciate the unexpected transformation of Scott's character in the viewer’s eyes. I've never seen a revenge movie where the lead is so deeply misguided and also doesn’t win.

This was the last movie in Indicator’s box set for me to watch, and I’d put it off for months because of the description. I thought I knew what this movie was going to be. It was that, but also something much more complicated. Not my favorite from the set, but better than expected.
