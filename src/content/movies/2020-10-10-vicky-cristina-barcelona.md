I remembered this as better than it is, but it’s not bad. Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson play off each other very well. The performances here are stronger than some of the other Allen movies I’ve watched recently, and they elevate the script. His dialogue requires a certain touch that not everyone has.
