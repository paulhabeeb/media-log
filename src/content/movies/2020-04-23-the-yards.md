The story is the least interesting thing here. The cinematography, sound design, and performances are the draws. And the weird power flickering thing, too. That’s great. But the characters don’t go much of anywhere. The performances are so understated. In another director’s hands they might have been much more over the top. Thankfully they aren’t.
