I am not a big Noah Baumbach fan. I find his way of approaching his themes tiring. He seems like a writer who uses his films as therapy. Which is fine, but I want something more than that. Or a different kind of therapy. Something that transcends self-indulgence. Perhaps that is asking too much.

But I believe this evaluation stands for his writing, not his directing. There are excellent choices here — casting, location, camera. Every single actor is incredible. No performance is wasted.

I’d have liked the movie to take a deeper dive into the loneliness of the divorce process. We start to get there when Adam Driver first meets Alan Alda, but it never goes further. Give us more of that, and we’ve got a great movie.
