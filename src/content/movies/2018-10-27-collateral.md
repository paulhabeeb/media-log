I first saw this around the time it came out and loved it. I tried to re-watch it a few years ago, but the unruly digital cinematography kept me from getting far. I still don't like it, and even watching something like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ1ZDlLImF8" rel="nofollow">the trailer for Blackhat</a> makes me cringe. It's a distracting visual choice. But the movie is solid. The first half is better than the second half, when the cops sweep in. But Michael Mann's gunshot sounds make everything worth it. He has a dedication to a certain kind of realism that I appreciate.
