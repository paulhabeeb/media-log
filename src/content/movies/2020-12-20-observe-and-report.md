This could have taken a dark, interesting turn at the end if the entire tone had become gravely serious after Rogen shoots the guy. Imagine if the guy died, and Rogen suddenly had to face actual consequences instead of living in a movie reality where he’s now the hero. I’d be interested in watching that movie.
