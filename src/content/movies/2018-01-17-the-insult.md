After a couple days thinking about this, I bumped it down from 3.5 to 2.5 stars.

As much as I love Lebanon and am predisposed by blood to root for anything from there, I can’t get over the easy psychological explanation this movie offers for Tony’s actions. It’s simple and lazy. Ziad can do better.
