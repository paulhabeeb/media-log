I don’t mind that there’s no explanation for this future world — in fact I prefer it — but I need more character motive than this provides. It feels chopped down from a longer script or cut. Several scenes happen with little emotional context for the characters. I’m just not sure I cared for the characters. The opening is great, and so is the end. But I don’t know about everything in between.
