There wasn’t much compelling in this story. The action is weak and watered down, and the story tips its hand instead of playing things out with suspense. The concept is interesting — the son embraces the unions and the father resists — but the execution doesn’t sing like it should. It ends up far more boring that it could have been. But really the problem is in the relationships between the characters. They’re ultimately hollow and uninteresting.
