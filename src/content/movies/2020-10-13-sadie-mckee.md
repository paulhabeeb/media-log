A wonderfully crafted script brought out by subtle performances that feel like they’d fit in a movie made 20 years later. There are some great camera moves here that aren’t extravagant but really make things go.

The script is very tight. The introduction of Esther Ralston’s character relatively late in the second act is interesting and unexpected for a movie of this time.

This is the third movie I’ve watched from the Criterion Channel’s collection of Joan Crawford’s movies, and I’m turning into a big fan. She’s really something else. She ranks up there with Maureen O’Hara for me.
