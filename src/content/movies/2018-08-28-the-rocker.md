After watching Superbad yesterday, I decided it would be a good idea to watch every one of Emma Stoneâ€™s movies in order, so here we go.

A movie with no urgency whatsoever, no stakes, nothing at all. Every time something might be at stake it gets easily smoothed over. Emma Stone weirdly looks younger than she did in Superbad.
