I appreciate that the movie treats its subject sincerely, and a lesser film would have explicitly revealed the answer to the mystery. The conceit is unique and interesting.

That said, the script needs a lot of work, the actors lack chemistry with each other, and none of the shots felt particularly motivated. Most of the decisions made don’t further the movie’s central conceit. There’s so much cruft. Each scene needs to be a focused unit, and it never feels that way.
