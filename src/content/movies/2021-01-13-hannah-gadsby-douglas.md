She does an excellent job at weaving all her jokes together throughout the set. I’ve never seen anyone do this so well. More comics need to operate this way. It helps build the entire piece, and all the jokes start to speak to each other and make each other funnier.

Unfortunately the actual humor felt quite weak and undercooked. The art history lesson was unique and somewhat funny, but the rest didn’t work all that well for me. They were like any observation you might have with your friends. Not quite as challenging or insightful as I’d hope for.

The ten minute opening also totally stunts the flow. That should have been two minutes max.
