The first four acts are wonderfully enjoyable, but the fifth just doesn’t quite do it for me. It’s the proposal scene in the church that falls flat. I think it’s a combination of blocking, shot choice, and performance that doesn’t quite add up. Maybe it’s the script, too. And I hoped for a sadder ending. Something less resolved.
