Lots of names here, but Brando outshines them all. He makes even bad dialogue interesting and novel.

This drags quite a bit. I’d have probably cut Robert Duvall and his wife. They don’t add anything to the main storyline, and anything they do add you get through the other characters anyway.

There’s so much talking you’d think this was adapted from a play, not a book. <i>Edit: And now that I do a little more reading, I learn that it </i>is <i>based on a play. Shocker.</i>
