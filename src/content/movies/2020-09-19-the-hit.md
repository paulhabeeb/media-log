A wonderful minimalism. Very surprised I've never seen this before or even heard much about it.

It's all about the criminals. The police pop up throughout the film only so their appearance at the end doesn't feel out of place. They're never given anything real to do.

A funny kind of road movie, or perhaps a funny kind of crime movie.
