The ending kills it, certainly, but everything that leads up to that point is so expected and uninteresting that I wasn't at all surprised by the poor decision.

Perhaps the one interesting part of the story is when Marco decides to play along with Ben’s secret and adopt it as his own. That decision is the most compelling part of the story, but unfortunately everything that surrounds it is so boring that it cannot save the movie. Charlotte’s reaction is uninteresting, and the story does not continue to play with our expectations in any real way. Until the end, of course...
