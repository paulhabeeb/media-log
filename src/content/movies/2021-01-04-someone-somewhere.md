Gene Hackman has a great line in <em>Night Moves</em>. He says that watching a Rohmer film is kinda like watching paint dry. I don't share his dim view of Rohmer, but the assessment is applicable to <em>Someone, Somewhere</em>. It is without any of the charms of Rohmer yet desperately slow and repetitive.

The premise is taken far too literally. It could be strengthened with greater emotional differentiation between the two main characters. They both have the same problems, and unfortunately they approach those problems in the same manner, which makes it feel like you’re watching the same movie twice.

They don’t meet until the end, which is one of the movie’s strengths, but it also means that that double feeling extends throughout the entire film.

On top of all this, the cinematography is wildly uncreative. There is no vision. The visuals are pretty but look like they could be from any Netflix show produced in the past five years. They are inoffensive but without soul. This kind of cinematography is the worst part of the digital revolution: technically proficiency, and even technical mastery, with no sense of visual storytelling. Everyone with a camera, calibrated monitor, and some LED lights can do this. I am not a film sentimentalist, but images like these make me pine for the time when it took so much more work to get a good image. The glut of crap is depressing. That said, wonderful movies are also made possible by this accessibility. You win some, you lose some.
