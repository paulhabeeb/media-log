I’m not sure this succeeds for me. The first 45 minutes don’t at all, and the last hour is spotty. I’m sure it was great 55 years ago, but it doesn’t hold up for me.

Weak exterior location work, generally poor supporting performances, aimless long takes. Feels like a good film school thesis, but not a good movie. Thought maybe they spent all their budget on sfx, with little left for the rest.
