The location work, performances, and of course Jack Cardiffâ€™s cinematography are the draws here.

The story really pushes up against the boundaries of its two-character, one-location conceit. The second half of the third act drags quite a bit. And the score is, at times, not all that appropriate.

Wish it were a little more serious, more dire, less Hollywood.
