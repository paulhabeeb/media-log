Very surprised at how much I liked this. I found it deeply touching in the kind of way that many find Itâ€™s a Wonderful Life touching, but without the nonsense holiday cheer and Frank Capra sentimentality.

Bette Davis looks like two entirely different people here. And the honest way they handle everything. And of course the way Henreid does the thing with the two cigarettes.
