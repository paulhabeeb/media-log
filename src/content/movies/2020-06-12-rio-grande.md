Maureen Oâ€™Hara really shines in this. There are several great scenes between her and John Wayne comprised almost solely of them looking at each other, or not looking at each other. Just visual storytelling. But John Wayne really should have died at the end. Did Ford ever kill Wayne? Allan Dwan did.
