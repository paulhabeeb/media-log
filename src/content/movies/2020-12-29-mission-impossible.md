Not as action packed as I remember. Perhaps my recollection is colored by the recent installments. Bourne is still my favorite action series, but I do enjoy M:I.

The first act is the most interesting here, with the most surprises and reveals â€” the masks, the job going wrong, the job being a mole hunt, that Claire is still alive.

The CIA infiltration is great, but lacks urgency on later viewings. The rest is all right. I don't get much from the last act. Sure, it's on a bullet train, but it's just not that interesting.
