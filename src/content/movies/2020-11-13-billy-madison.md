Recently I've watched a few classic Sandler movies for the first time, and the problem with all of them so far is the total lack of cinematic consequences for his characters. As you watch these movies, you know that even the worst thing that happens will even out. You never feel something truly bad could take its toll. It's just: something bad happens, Sandler finds a way to make it better. These are the kinds of movies you can watch in the background and not miss a thing.
