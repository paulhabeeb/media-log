This could’ve been really good, and it also could’ve been much worse. The jokes didn’t hit hard enough, and the mystery needed more twists and turns. But it was a fine, bland movie.

Looking at the other scripts James Vanderbilt has written, I’m amazed that he wrote <i>Zodiac</i>, which is by far Fincher’s best movie. Kinda like how Tom McCarthy directed both <i>Spotlight</i> and <i>The Cobbler</i>.
