Two odd halves to a film. They almost feel disconnected from each other. The first is confusing and forced. The second is much more interesting and probably should have been fleshed out to be the entire story.

Itâ€™s always fun watching movies like this from an era se perceive as having classic after classic. Not everything is groundbreaking, even with stars in it and directing and writing.
