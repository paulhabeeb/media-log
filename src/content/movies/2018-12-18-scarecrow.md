Pacino is incredible in this. I've never seen him play anything similar. And the variety in his performances in the early 70s — from <em>Needle Park</em> to <em>The Godfather</em> to <em>Serpico</em> to this — is astounding. He worked with Schatzberg, Coppola, and Lumet, then all three again, in the same order.
