Joan Crawford is so much more at ease in her performances than most other Golden Age stars. She can lean against a desk and look at Clark Gable like no one else. Bette Davis would do it in her own way, and it would be great, and so would Barbara Stanwyck, Olivia de Havilland, or Carole Lombard, but none of them would have the pure ease of Joan Crawford. They’d all be <i>performing</i>. Crawford is the closest thing to <i>being</i> that we got in the Golden Age.

This movie is lots of fun, though a bit lightweight. Somehow it has Crawford and Gable, plus Fred Astaire and the Three Stooges. The gym scene is fun, as is the moment when Joan and Fred suddenly turn into Germans. A lot of wonderful moments and scenes, but a lazy story.
