Not nearly as stressful the second time around. Iâ€™m not sure it does anything for me personally beyond pure spectacle and memeability. Anything significant I could take away is too removed and academic.

The first time around it was hard to appreciate the craft because of the sheer immersion of the viewing experience, but this time I was amazed by the sound design. The work they put in there is wild.
