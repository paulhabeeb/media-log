Apart from its racism, <i>Badge 373</i> has poorly-conceived characters, bad dialogue, awkward blocking, janky shot choice, and choppy pacing. In the very first scene there are moments when Duvall’s hardly in character, like he doesn’t know what he’s supposed to feel.

And that’s the overall problem — each scene, each moment doesn’t build on the previous. They’re just stacked one after the other. Why does he go upstate with his girlfriend? To retrieve the guns? Give us two minutes of that, not ten.

Indicator put this out on Blu-ray, so I thought I’d be getting a treat of some kind. No, thank you. I’m surprised anyone went to the trouble of restoring this thing. There is a world in which this could’ve been good...maybe with a different edit, better writer, and more inspired director...but we don’t live in that world.

The only pleasure here is the 70s New York grit.
