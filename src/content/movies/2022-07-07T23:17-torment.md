Emmanuelle Beart’s performance in the first act is so over the top and cliche that I almost gave up. The entire premise is totally up my alley but it’s implemented in a kind of tired way. But the performances work well (at least after the first act). I don’t love Chabrol’s camera or shot or lens choice, but the light is great.
