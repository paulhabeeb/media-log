My first Costa-Gavras. The first act was really quite superb, with almost a documentary feel — the sudden slide into social and political chaos, with sporadic gunfire interrupting conversations, the terror of curfew, and so on — and the second act was quite good, too.

After that, it becomes only a very good movie, but not the five-star film it had been. The search isn’t quite as interesting for me, and the end, in particular, was just okay. I understand it’s based on a true story, but I wish it weren’t.
