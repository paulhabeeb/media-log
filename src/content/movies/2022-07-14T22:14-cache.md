What a movie to compare to this morning’s. I’ve been meaning to rewatch it, and the so-so quality of this morning’s movie prompted me to.

How do they compare?

-   In Caché, the problem presents itself immediately, and there's good reason, it's creepy, we understand why they're concerned, not just a general paranoia.
-   Caché has a much different visual style, using longer takes. There's a much stronger visual hand guiding the film. Watcher was inoffensive but bland. The shots work but they never let you sink into the characters or story. The terror isn't as psychological.
-   Much more conceptual, bigger ideas, i.e., shot on DV for a reason, and disorients us with the long shots, the shots of the steps where it's hard to immediately see who we're supposed to focus on
-   And the random shots of the boy bleeding from the mouth
-   Also lacks a definite ending. We never find out who sent the tapes. And it doesn't matter. It's not about that. Whereas in the other movie it's definitely about that.
