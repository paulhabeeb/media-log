John Wayne acts so well when he’s just listening to two other characters speak.

Howard Hawks is always fun, but for me he never reaches the artistic highs of Ford. The first act of this — the silent first scene, the moody, spatially-aware cinematography, all the performances — approached a masterpiece. But through the third and fourth acts it meanders and degrades to being just really good.

Wayne’s performance does a weird thing when he’s opposite Angie Dickinson. His voice goes high and he over acts. I guess it’s his attempt at flirting, but it doesn’t work for me. In fact, I’m not sure how that story line adds to the picture at all.
