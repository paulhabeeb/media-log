Really not much here at all. Walter Matthau was great, but Jack Lemmon’s schtick was annoying, not funny. Very surprised this spawned a tv show and sequel. I’m also surprised at its pace. It’s not until halfway through the movie that Lemmon starts annoying Matthau. It was the first half, when everyone is worried about Lemmon, that was funniest.
