As a kid I taped this and <i>Sands of Iwo Jima</i> off TV and watched them more times than I can remember. Others, too, I’m sure, but those two stand out the most. John Wayne was always the draw. I had no idea who Kirk Douglas was.

Nothing really special about this one in hindsight, but still fun. RIP Kirk.
