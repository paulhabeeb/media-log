Hard to rate this since I watched it as part of my French immersion, meaning there were no subtitles and I understood only bits and pieces. And it wasn’t image-heavy. All the important plot points were conveyed through dialogue. I got the gist but not the nuance. But I imagine it’s probably about a 3 or 3.5.
