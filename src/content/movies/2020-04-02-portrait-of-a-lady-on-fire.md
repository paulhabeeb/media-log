Weirdly emotionless. Not bad at all — wonderful craft at work, with a beautiful way of letting things linger. But the story moves along through the first three and a half acts at a distance that left me feeling nothing through the characters. It’s more academic than emotional. By the time things get interesting, I didn’t feel all that invested. Maybe a rewatch will change this.

I guess, in the end, it had me thinking more than it had me feeling. That’s fine, but I’d have preferred the opposite. The point would have been more pungent that way.

<strong>EDIT:</strong> And after thinking about it for a few days, I realize <em>Portrait...</em> hit me the same way <em>Boyhood</em> hit me: an interesting concept that overshadows its characters. Thankfully there's much more at work here than in <em>Boyhood</em>, for which I have a deep animosity.
