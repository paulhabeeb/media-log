The contrast of Emilia Clarke’s smiling, cheery demeanor with what she’s hiding about herself makes this work. Depressed people don’t always go around moping in front of others. They often seem fine. Her character wasn’t necessarily depressed, but the contrast of someone so smiley with something she clearly doesn’t like to talk about creates an interesting character. The idea of a character with a secret is of course a well-worn trope of rom-coms, but the execution here is much different, and with any other actor it wouldn't work.

And the moment when she starts to sing to Henry Golding feels real and raw and perfect. This moment in a more serious movie would earn far more respect.

That said, the script is all over the place, and the twist is groan-inducing and nearly kills the whole thing. I would’ve liked her struggle to deal with her dreams of singing rather than her family, but it’s a Christmas movie, so of course it has to be about family.

I’m also quite disappointed with the way Feig chose to direct the final scene. We get nothing more than boring coverage from six or seven angles, panning slowly across the crowd. What a missed opportunity to show off Clarke’s singing talents and to give us solid moments with all the supporting characters. Perhaps I expect too much.
