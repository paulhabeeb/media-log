Plods along. Once they’re at the country home it gets rather slow. Crawford’s character has an interesting dilemma, falling for someone who she’s going to rob, and the story waits a satisfying amount of time before revealing what she’s up to. But the rest of it just isn’t all that interesting. The struggle is too easy, and there’s not enough conniving by Crawford and her crew.
