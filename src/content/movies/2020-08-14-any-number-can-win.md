I had an opportunity to see this in a theater as part of an Alain Delon retrospective a couple years ago but missed it. I've been wanting to see it ever since, and it's a hard movie to track down. I'm glad the Criterion Channel added it.

The perfect bridge between Gabin's generation and Delon's. This wasn't the only movie they made together, but it certainly is a classic. What an ending.
