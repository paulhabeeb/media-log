Love the unexpected combination of genres. But it feels very surface. I think it’s the voiceover. Allen uses it as a crutch so the script doesn’t have to take a deep dive into the characters. He doesn’t put them in the right situations to reveal themselves, instead relying on the voiceover.

That elevator scene, though. The fight is amazing. So messy, so realistic. Joaquin actually has another great fight like that in <i>The Yards</i>.
