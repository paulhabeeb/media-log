There are interesting things at play here — the neorealism that shifts into a thriller, the surprising sexuality, the beautiful cinematography — things that, if I wrote enough, could intellectualize this into a higher rating. But really, it needed to be longer to get that higher rating. We needed to linger more, to get more character. Otherwise it’s all intellectual. That said, I loved the pieces.
