The kind of movie that’s right up my alley. The suspense and paranoia work perfectly. A wonderful escalation of isolation and terror. But the characters never feel all that real, and often times their decisions don’t make much sense. The husband has no real reason not to believe his wife, but he also doesn’t seem stupid or uncaring enough to simply be a jerk. And why don’t they look in the closet when the murderer is hiding there? Julia knows he’s there. And why does she let approach the guy’s door alone?
