It’s a lot of fun to watch Jonah Hill and Emma Stone play all their characters, and Justin Theroux, Sonoya Mizuno, and Billy Magnussen are excellent, too. But that’s about it. The rest is a hodgepodge of other, better shows and movies, and it feels generally empty. I had the feeling multiple times that the creative rationale for certain decisions was “But they’re dreaming, so it works, right?” But it’s fun. It’s bingeable. But it’s not perfect by any means.
