This was more fun than the other new Star Wars I’ve seen, but it still feels inconsequential in comparison to the original trilogy. I’d really like to see something that doesn’t feel the need to hit all those cute backstory marks, uses its blocking and shot choice in a much more daring way, and just has a cohesive script.
