What a mess. This kind of script really isn’t suited to Lumet’s realistic style. It could’ve been something really fun, like Ocean’s 11, but instead all the liberties the story takes with realistic possibility — they thought they were <i>really</i> going to knock over that entire building? — become distractions. Tellingly, the most interesting part was the police rappelling from roof to roof.

On top of that, none of the characters have anything real driving them, both the score and depiction of technology have not aged well, and that ending nullifies all the surveillance scenes that were scattered throughout the first two acts.
