I’m surprised this one didn’t work for me, but it was all in the story. I suppose Ford felt he had to exalt Lincoln, but in doing so he stripped the man of any kind of interesting struggle, leaving the movie and character without any real driving force. The plot kind of floats around outside Lincoln, and there are interesting moments, but it never amounts to much, which is unfortunate. This could have been something really interesting. Alas.
