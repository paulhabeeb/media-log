This might be my favorite of all of James Gray’s movies. I saw its first run back in 2009, and it had a deep impact on me then. It’s different for me now — I see it more for the bleak story it is.

Back then I wanted Joaquin to be with Gwyneth because that’s what his character wanted. This time around it was clear she’d never be with him, and I wanted him to embrace Vinessa. But both then and now I felt the ending was so, so sad.

I’m glad Gray decided not to make a genre film. I didn’t realize it until now, but I’ve felt that those elements bound his previous films to certain kinds of characters and actions that ultimately hindered their stories. And in those films it always felt like he was reaching for something grand, which always felt forced. Here it’s simpler and more focused, which gives it power.
