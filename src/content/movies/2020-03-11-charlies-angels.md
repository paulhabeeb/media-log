I really wish I could give this higher marks. Lately I’ve started to deeply appreciate Kristen Stewart, and Elizabeth Banks is great. But...a high level of storytelling craft is simply not present here. Things jump around so much, there’s no real through line for any of the characters, the humor doesn’t add anything real, and it’s just scene after scene with no purpose. There was a lot of potential here, and it’s disappointing for it to have been wasted so much.

With stronger characters and more interesting casting choices, it could’ve been something really special, like <i>Hustlers (</i>which was also somewhat disappointing, but merely for me, personally, from a directorial standpoint).
