Fun. Commendable in aim but not all there in execution. The tone shifts don’t work all that well, and frankly for them to land it should’ve been twenty minutes longer. Also a visually uninteresting film. We hang in a lot of medium shots that the aspect ratio doesn’t do a lot of favors for. It needed a stronger hand guiding the setups for each scene. The story comes across, but mostly because of the dialogue and performances. The images should help, too! All that said, I enjoyed it.
