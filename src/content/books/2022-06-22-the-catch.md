This isn’t the kind of book I’d normally pick up, but I found myself staying up late each night, reading past point at which I said I’d stop. The characters have some interesting quirks, and the story’s mystery propels you through each chapter. There’s a nice breadth to the characters. Ultimately it’s not my kind of book -- a bit too contrived, and the character reversals aren’t sharp enough. The character learns something new about her father that changes her perception of him, but by the end she’s back to having the same feeling. It’s not that every book needs to be wildly dramatic. She doesn’t have to learn that her father is a rapist or a Nazi sympathizer. But not enough changed by the end of the book. Not enough felt like it was at stake. The baseball was a flimsy device. But all that said, it was enjoyable to read.
