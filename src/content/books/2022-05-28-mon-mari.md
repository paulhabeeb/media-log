Hard to really have a grasp on this since I read it in French and my French is not advanced enough to understand books aimed at adults. I can real Petit Nicolas and understand it, but this is on another level. Particularly the tone.

I couldn’t tell if the main character was supposed to be annoying or funny. She came off annoying to me, but reading reviews of the book, it seems like native speakers found her funny. So I don’t know if this is a language thing (likely) or simply a difference in taste (less likely, but possible).

The entire book is from the wife’s point of view, save for the last chapter, which is from the husband’s. I like this choice and the menacing context it gives to the rest of the story.
